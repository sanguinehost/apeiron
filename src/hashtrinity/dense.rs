//! The Count face at the identity address function — the table whose key *is* its address.
//!
//! The crate header's claim is *"the key is its own address when it can be. An integer key smaller
//! than the array indexes directly — no hash, no collision, one probe."* [`Dense`] is that claim
//! taken to its limit and made into a type: when the key space is a known-bounded coordinate range
//! that the caller has already linearised, the address function is the **identity**, there is no
//! probe at all, and liveness is not a separate fact — an absent cell *is* the merge's identity
//! element, which is the value already sitting there.
//!
//! This is the face [`crate::hashtrinity::Table`] and [`crate::hashtrinity::CoordMap`] cannot degenerate to. Both keep a
//! `coords: Box<[u64]>` liveness/identity column (8 bytes per **slot**, not per live key) in a
//! power-of-two array that must run below full to keep probes short. That is the right trade when
//! the occupied coordinates are a sparse and unknown subset of a large space. It is the wrong trade
//! when the caller can enumerate the whole space and most of it is live: the coordinate column then
//! stores what the index already says, and the load-factor slack buys nothing.
//!
//! `Dense` is therefore not an escape from the trinity — it is the trinity's B-face keystore
//! ([`crate::hashtrinity::Regen`]) with the fold collapsed to `id`, which deletes the coordinate column and the
//! probe together. What it keeps is exactly what the accumulator is *for*:
//!
//! | | |
//! |---|---|
//! | the merge | [`Monoid::combine`] — one `f`, the only freedom |
//! | absence | [`Monoid::identity`] — an absent key reads as the identity, never a sentinel |
//! | the merge of two tables | [`Dense::fuse`] — elementwise, order-free by construction |
//! | the group inverse | [`Dense::unfuse`] — exact, or refused ([`Group::remove`]) |
//! | locality | [`Dense::span`] — the contiguous-range GET, free because addresses are coordinates |
//!
//! `fuse`/`unfuse` are the two properties a count fold is bought for: **exactly mergeable** and
//! **exactly unfoldable**. Getting them from here rather than from a hand-written `for` loop per
//! call site is the whole point of the type — a hand-rolled `checked_sub` loop is where a group
//! inverse silently stops being one.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use apeiron::hashtrinity::Dense;
//! let mut a = Dense::<u32>::zeros(4);
//! a.add(1, 5);
//! a.add(3, 2);
//! let mut b = Dense::<u32>::zeros(4);
//! b.add(1, 7);
//!
//! a.fuse(&b);
//! assert_eq!(a.get(1), 12);
//! assert_eq!(a.get(0), 0); // absent reads as the identity
//!
//! a.unfuse(&b); // the exact group inverse
//! assert_eq!(a.get(1), 5);
