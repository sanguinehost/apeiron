# The RMSNorm backward kernel's traffic model (P83)

`ApeironWord` is imported for the FORM-ORPHAN reachability edge: this cost model prices a GPU
kernel that is waived from extraction (its SPIR-V builder and dispatch are the `gpu`/`ffi`
classes), so no extracted definition is used here.

`src/gpu/nn/norm_bwd.rs` dispatches one workgroup per row. One dispatch over `t` rows of width
`w` reads `x`, `gain`, `dy` and writes `dx`, `dγ_rows`: four `t·w` tensors and the `w`-wide gain,
four bytes per f32.

    bytes(t, w) = (4·t·w + w) · 4

At the device's 960 GB/s the memory floor is `bytes / 960·10^9` seconds: 7.34 MB and 7.65 µs at
`t = 512`, `w = 896`. The arithmetic is about ten flops per element, two orders below that floor
at the machine's fp32 rate (a `model` input from P83). The host `sum_dgamma_rows` fold is
O(`t·w`) and is the named open work; a device-side reduction replaces it.

What is proved here: the row's cost equation, expanded. The memory floor itself is a roofline
instance at a declared machine bandwidth, not a kernel property (obligation 11); no theorem here
produces a byte or a microsecond.
