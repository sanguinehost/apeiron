# The citation registry

One entry per source, keyed by the string used in `@cite`. `Apeiron.Linter.Citation` checks
during elaboration that every `@cite` key resolves here, so a key naming nothing fails the
build instead of reading as a citation.

A `@cite` line goes in a module docstring or in any declaration's docstring. Put it on the
declaration when a source supports that one result, and on the module when it is the subject
of the file.

The linter catches a key that resolves to nothing. It cannot catch an entry crediting the
wrong person, which is a reading question and stays with whoever adds the entry.
